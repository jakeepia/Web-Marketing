## Project Overview:
In this project, I developed a comprehensive Web Marketing Dashboard using Tableau to track, analyze, and interpret key web performance metrics for effective decision-making. The dashboard provides a detailed view of session activity, bounce rates, page views, and user behavior across devices, making it easier to monitor web traffic trends and identify areas for improvement in the user journey.

- **Average Page Load Time:** 72 seconds – Indicates how quickly pages load on average, which impacts user satisfaction.

### 2. Monthly Session Trends

The “Latest Year Sessions” bar chart presents monthly web session data:
